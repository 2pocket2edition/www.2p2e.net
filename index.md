**2p2e** is the first server for Minecraft: Pocket Edition (and other versions of Bedrock) that is true anarchy. There's a number of other servers that attempt to sell themselves as "anarchy" servers, but none of them are really and truly anarchy.

The IP to connect is `play.2p2e.net`. The port is the default (`19132`).

We also have a [Discord](https://discordapp.com) server! [The invite link is here](https://discord.gg/E9KfsPN).
